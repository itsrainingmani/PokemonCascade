# PokemonCascade

This is intended to be an open-world, fan-made Pokémon game. No afilliation with Nintendo, The Pokémon Company, Game Freak,
or any other entity licensed to use these intellectual properties.

This game currently (Dec 2019) contains only the first generation of Pokémon (151), and has no plans to include more, 
due to the amount of work to add the extras.

Nearly none of the code is commented, and while some effort was made to create relatively readable code, I'm only
a hobby programmer.

The game is built on the mechanics present from the third generation of Pokémon games, with a few alterations:
  1. Gender is meaningless
  2. No abilities (yet(?))
  3. 

Contents:
1. Battler - testBattleClass.py
2. Map Makers/Editors - mapSquareMaker.py, mapSquareEditor.py, mapMaker.py, autoMapMaker.py
3. Main game test - mapTest.py

1. Battler
Choose up to six pokemon to battle against a random team of three.

2. Map Makers
Create 32x32 grid maps with mapSquareMaker, change the fine parameters of each tile with mapSquareEditor, and stitch them
together with mapMaker.

3. Main Game (Test)
Contains basic functionality to play maps and test encounters.
